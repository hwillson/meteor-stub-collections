# Meteor - Stub Collections

## Intro

Easily stub out Meteor collections with in-memory local collections. The idea here is to allow the use of things like Factories for unit tests and styleguides without having to restrict ourselves to making components "pure". So a component (ie. a template) can still call `Widgets.findOne(widgetId)`, it's just that we will have stubbed out `Widgets` to point to a local collection that we can completely control in our test.

## Installation

```
meteor add hwillson:stub-collections
```

### Usage via ES6 import

```js
// client or server
import StubCollections from 'meteor/hwillson:stub-collections';
```

## API

- `StubCollections.add([collection1, collection2, ...])` - register the default list of collections to stub.
- `StubCollections.stub()` - stub all collections that have been previously enabled for stubbing via `add()`.
- `StubCollections.stub([collection1, collection2, ...])` - stub a specific list of collections, overriding the list registered via `add()`.
- `StubCollections.restore()` - undo stubbing (call at the end of tests, on routing away, etc.)

## Examples

See this packages [tests](https://github.com/hwillson/meteor-stub-collections/blob/3a0ac26121d8e864cd5b78959b0edb7b9532c761/stub_collections.tests.js).

## Testing

```bash
$ meteor test-packages ./ --driver-package=meteortesting:mocha
```
